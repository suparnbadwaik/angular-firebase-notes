## Using Firebase with Angular (2+)
To use firebase in an angular app, you need to install the below packages first of all.

`npm install firebase angularfire2 --save`
firebase - provides the Database
angularfire2 - provides the firebase class needed by angular to interact with it

You can then import the AngularFireModule and AngularFireDatabaseModule in the App module file.

To use, inject AngularFireDatabase in the class you wanna use it and then use the commands to list or save the data.


## Issues
You might face some issue of angular not having read/write access to the firebase Database.
